# CLMUD Workflow Cheatsheet

- Start the server with `./dev.sh start` or `sbcl --script mud.lisp` before connecting via `telnet localhost 4000`.
- Run `./dev.sh validate` after edits for balance + compilation; use `./dev.sh balance` when checking structure mid-edit.
- Keep edits s-expression-safe; prefer the helpers and guidance in [DEVELOPMENT.md](mdc:docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and store tooling in `tools/`.
- For diagnostics, rely on the `dev.sh` subcommands (`check`, `test`, `clean`) described in [DEVELOPMENT.md](mdc:docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
