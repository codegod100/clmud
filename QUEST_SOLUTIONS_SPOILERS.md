## Tips and Notes

1. **All quests are repeatable** - you can complete them multiple times for XP and rewards
2. **Quests start by talking to NPCs** - use `talk <npc>` command to start quests, not `quest start`
3. **Faction quests give faction favor** - completing them increases your standing with that faction
4. **Quest items are marked** - they cannot be sold and are clearly identified
5. **Quest completion is automatic** - when you meet the requirements, the quest completes immediately
6. **Check your status** - use `status` command to see your current level, health, mana, and XP progress
7. **Faction mobs** - killing faction-aligned mobs will decrease your standing with that faction (-15 favor)
8. **Quest dialogue** - talking to quest givers shows different dialogue based on quest state (not started, in progress, completed)
